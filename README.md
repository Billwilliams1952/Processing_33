# Processing_33
Processing sketches.  My learning curve using a new development environment (Processing) and programming language (Java).

From: https://processing.org/

>"Processing is a flexible software sketchbook and a language for learning how to code within the context of the visual arts. Since 2001, Processing has promoted software literacy within the visual arts and visual literacy within technology."


## SteeringBehaviors

This sketch was inspired by two people: 
- Craig W. Reynolds for his paper "Steering Behaviors For Autonomous Characters"  http://www.red3d.com/cwr/papers/1999/gdc99steer.pdf
- Daniel Shiffman for all of his great work for the Processing community via YouTube videos and at http://shiffman.net/

The sketch provides multiple simulations illustrating autonomous steering behaviors.

## SuperShape

Inspired by Paul Bourke's work with supershapes found at http://paulbourke.net/geometry/supershape/
